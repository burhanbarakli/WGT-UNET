# WGT-UNET
High-Performance Segmentation of Power Lines in Aerial Images Using a Wavelet-Guided Hybrid Transformer Network


After the evaluation of the manuscript, the codes, pretrained .pth files, and output results of all the compared models, as well as the implementation, outputs, and segmentation masks of the proposed model, will be made publicly available at https://github.com/burhanbarakli/WGT-UNET

The output masks and dataset related to the models are provided at the following link:  
[Google Drive – Model Outputs and Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UdcoLUCJRmvDEzymn2Dj95pibTOeH120?usp=sharing)

The masks were generated from the corresponding JSON annotation files.  
The original images were obtained from the official TTPLA repository:
